# Browser Autofill Phishing üêü

This is a simple demonstration of form fields hidden from the user, but will be
filled anyways when using the browser form autofill feature, which poses a
security risk for users, unaware of giving their information to the website.

## Google Chrome Behaviour

Here's the demo in action on the Google Chrome Browser:

## Other browsers

It works differently in some other browsers. For example:

* In Safari, it will tell you all the data it is filling into the form, even
  if it isn't visible to you.

* In Firefox, you have to right click an input field and then select an
  identity to use. So in Firefox user autofills each field.
